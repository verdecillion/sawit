  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/main.css"/>

      <p>Good morning, Samuel.<br/><br/>I wanted to follow up on the giants. Apparently there have been many spotted in Alabama? I have been researching forum websites, “SawIt” seems to be big on these. Care to elaborate on your failure?<br/><br/>I believe we paid you several million dollars to construct a glass case, and send the giants and the eggs REGULARLY and SPARINGLY. Have you been putting them out everywhere?<br/><br/>Thank you, Rick</p>

      <p>Good afternoon, Rick.<br/><br/>I believe you miscalculated what you were seeing. We send out giants every month or so, in batches of 3. I do not believe this is our mistake. You need to be more aware of what you’re consuming online, Rick.<br/><br/>We planned everything out, we cannot let it have too much fear. It can’t take it. We are VERY cautious to uphold that responsibility.<br/><br/>Much appreciated, Samuel.</p>

      <p>I don’t think you quite understand what’s happening, Sam. These things are being seen all over the country. We cannot afford the major public to find out about this. Everything must be kept as under the radar as possible. You act as if there’s multiple of these pits. It has to be an issue on YOUR side. Fix it.<br/><br/>Thank you, Rick</p>
