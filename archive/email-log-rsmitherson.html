      <p>Good morning, Samuel.<br/><br/>This message is in regards to financial aid for facility [DATA EXPUNGED], in dealing with the probability that they go rogue.<br/><br/>You’re certain that containing this in a glass box will work? The funds are available to you, upon response. The eggs and their strength are not to be tested so mindlessly.<br/><br/>Thank you, Richard</p>

      <p>Good morning, Rick.<br/><br/>Yes, I firmly believe that investing in this method of containment would be not only cost efficient but also effective.<br/><br/>The eggs would not be able to climb the glass, we have seen their legs in action. In addition, I would also believe that we can transport the giants while they are small and release them into the wild using the human entrance as a delivery zone.<br/><br/>Another added benefit of the container being made of glass is that we can constantly monitor the pit and the things exiting.<br/><br/>Much appreciated, Samuel</p>
