  <!-- A link to your CSS file, to automatically apply it. 
    Filepath goes in href. Add extra period for every sub directory
    the file is under.
    Ex: if in root/directory/html, it would be "../css/" -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/main.css"/>

  <!-- This is a link to the "favicon, or the icon on the tab.
  The default one is in root as "favicon.ico". If you would like 
  a custom one, put it in assets. 
  Filepath follows same conventions as CSS -->
