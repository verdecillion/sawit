  <h1><b>WATCH OUT: Crazy Man Spouts Nonsense; Harms Innocent Man</b></h1>
  <p>Residents of Saint Louis were made uncomfortable today when a man, later identified as Jeremy Ballard, was seen cavorting around town early in the morning. Eye witnesses claim he was declaring that the government had taken his friend, by which he called “Thomas Wernicke”.<br/><br/>“I mean, I don’t know. It just kind of scared me, I guess? We don’t normally get crazy people like that around here. I trust my government, I don’t think what he was saying was any kind of truth,” says an interviewed eye witness.<br/><br/>Authorities responded to the noise complaint, and reporting officer Deputy Wiggums was forced to deploy his taser after Ballard attacked a local shop owner who was attempting to de-escalate the situation. Ballard also attacked Deputy Wiggums in the ensuing arrest.<br/><br/>“I was trying to get him away from my store, he was scaring away every single one of my customers,” says the interviewed shop owner, “and then the guy spins around and hits me with the craziest haymaker I’ve ever seen. I can’t feel my cheek.”<br/><br/>Jeremy Ballard was taken into custody this afternoon, and is looking at several charges, including disrupting the peace, aggravated assault against a police officer, resisting arrest, among others. More information will follow as the situation develops.
