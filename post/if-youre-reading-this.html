                <div class="post-seperation">
                  <p>Look, I know we’ve all gone through stuff like this before. Yes, the government has tracking everywhere. Yes, every truth-seeker probably has two or more government employees watching you. We’ve all been there, and we’ve all seen it. But this is DIFFERENT.<br/><br/>It all started off pretty normal, I saw some disguised feds following me down the road a few months ago. Everyone like us goes through that at some point. I did my SEP (Standard Evasion Procedures) and got them off my trail, like any other day. When I got home that night, I switched off the electric in my apartment and did the routine sweep for bugs. Didn’t find any bugs and the alarms hadn’t tripped, meaning the feds hadn’t put anything, right? Well later that night, when I looked up there was some weird brownish liquid DRIPPING from a crack that hadn’t been there before. I didn’t know what it was supposed to be, because it was thick, and stunk to high heaven.<br/><br/>I figured that maybe some fed equipment could have started sagging through the ceiling, so I opened my hatch to the ceiling to make sure there wasn't anything planted. But ALL that was up there was this weird slime! Has anyone here ever gone through anything like this before? WHAT could this have been?</p>
                </div>
                <p>So I took all of your advice, and I have moved from that apartment. The management officially said it was a problem with some of the plumbing, but I’m fairly certain it had to do with the feds I saw earlier that day.<br.></br.>I’ve moved to a small wooden home in a rural area on the west of the Mississippi. To be honest, I should’ve done that MUCH earlier. I risked being in a city for way too long, honestly shocked I didn’t run into any problems earlier.<br/><br/>I got a good deal on this little shack. The previous man living here was talking about a bunch of weird stuff, like seeing all sorts of sasquatches and fishmen. Either he had a screw loose or the isolated location was getting to him, methinks. Doesn’t matter to me :P.<br/><br/>It’s my first time in a while being somewhere that has a big outdoors around it. What are the recommended procedures for fed searches in a forested area?</p>
              </div>
              <p>Set up some perimeter defenses as you all advised, but I’m already seeing some weird stuff. I’d like y’alls opinion on all of this.<br/><br/>So the other week, after setting up my perimeter I was out on lookout. Pretty typical right? Well, while I was up there this weird huge flying bug thing started circling around me. I clapped it in my hands expecting it to be some bug but it was nothing like any bug I’ve seen before. When I looked at my hand, instead of seeing some bug, it looked more like meat? Imagine a quarter-inch of bloody ground beef, that’s what it looked like. Out of reflex I wiped it off on a nearby tree. Strange bug but whatever, I have bigger fish to fry.<br/><br/>Well that's what I thought at least! That THING launched off the tree and flew away! I haven’t seen it since that night, but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. Has anyone ever seen anything like that? Is this some common bug that my city-boy self wouldn’t recognize, or is this some new bio-surveillance device or something??</p>
            </div>
            <p>I’m glad you all also think that’s weird. I’ve begun thinking that the government might have me on some list for surveillance. I’ve kept seeing weird things around and I think that they really have it out for me.<br/><br/>At night, I’ve been hearing twigs snapping, rusting in the leaves, and other things. Now I thought this was just animals doing their thing, but not only have I seen NO animals the month that I’ve been here, but if I listen closely, I can sometimes hear TALKING!<br/><br/>I was very sure that it was the feds, but I set up a 360 camera just to make sure it wasn't some rowdy teenagers. But when I went to check the next morning, the camera was GONE. It wasn’t destroyed, because there were no parts on the ground. And I know it wasn't stolen, because I had it transmitting its data to a server at my place. It’s like it just simply stopped existing. Has anyone else ever seen anything like this?? I’m really considering leaving the country.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Ok. I think I really need to pack my things. Maybe I’ve lost my mind or the isolated location is getting to me, but I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.<br/><br/>Firstly, to clarify for the commenters. When I say no animals, I mean NO animals. Other than the weird bug I mentioned a few posts ago, I have seen NO life. Not a single deer, not a single squirrel, not a single insect, NOTHING. I know the government is up to this. I don’t know how they’re doing it or why, but they’re obviously drawing all of the animals away from me. Could it be some 5G or ultrasonic transmitters or something? Could the feds have slipped something into my groceries this month, or injected me with something? I haven't had any vaccines in the last 25 years but I was given some as a teenager by my sheeple parents. Could it be that??<br/><br/>Second, you guys said to search around the camera for clues. I did a small search previously but I was overwhelmed by everything and hadn’t done any more. I had the camera wired to a solar-powered battery a little bit away for power, and I knew that hadn’t been taken so took a look at the power cable. It looked like it had been DISSOLVED in the middle. Does anybody know a way this happened? It’s not an acid, because there was no residue on the wire, and there was no sign of what was used on the ground around the camera. <br/><br/>Thirdly, I’ve noticed small little holes in the ground around me. Twisted the hell out of my ankle the other day tripping on one. I would have figured they were the work of some animal, but I would like to reiterate that there has been NO LIFE to be seen. I walked for miles around, and until I made it to the nearby town, I saw not one animal. I’ve dug up some of the holes to make sure that there’s nothing hidden inside of them, but they always collapse before I can see the bottom of it. A lot of them are shaped in a sort of 90-45 degree angle, going about 6 inches down before suddenly turning to a side. I’ve researched a lot and I’ve found NOTHING similar to this reported on here. Does anyone have ANY ideas?</p>
        </div>
        <p>I feel like I’ve finally lost it. I’m glad I’ve been documenting this for you all, so that at least someone knows what I’ve been through.<br/><br/>I found where all the animals have been. On a patrol yesterday I saw what looked like a dead snake. Except, it had no head or tail. Or SKIN. It really just looked like a cut of ground beef. However, there was something resembling a blood trail leading away (or towards?) it. So I followed it.<br/><br/>I’m not sure whether that was the right decision. I kept finding these snake corpses while following the trail. I ended up tripping on one of those holes I mentioned earlier, and I landed on one of those things. AND IT WAS WARM!!!!<br/><br/>WHY was this thing warm?!? If it had been alive not too long ago, what was it doing here, and how would there have been time to skin it and cut off its ends? And also, if it was warm, whatever killed it would have to be nearby, right??? But I saw and heard NOTHING. I also realized that when I fell on it, it left some dark residue on my sleeve. I don’t think it was blood, but I also don’t know what else it would be.<br/><br/>After following this trail for actual MILES, I noticed there was a huge CRATER in the ground. I had been around this place before when surveying the area and it WASN’T HERE then. The crater was like 100 METERS WIDE and it had been made within the last MONTH AND A HALF! I had to investigate, obviously. This had to be some government base or something, is what I thought.  There was also a little cave entrance or something down there. I carefully descended into the crater until I could see in the cave entrance.<br/><br/>Inside the cave entrance was some sort of creature or something, and a lot of animal carcasses. I’m not even really sure how to describe it, but I’ll try for the post. It was like a huge pile of carrion, with little tentacles or something all sprouting off of it. It was COVERED with eyes and teeth and shards of bones and all sorts of other things. AND IT WAS MOVING. This wasn’t a pile of dead animals, this was some kind of living being, and it was pulsating and wriggling and the eyes on it were all looking around. It was some kind of nightmare creature.<br/><br/>When one of the eyes on it looked at me, all of the others suddenly locked on as well. And it started pulsing faster.<br/><br/>So of course I ran the hell away. What else was I supposed to do? I ran all the way back to my house to process what the hell I saw, and what my next move should be. I remembered that one of the firearm shops in the town had a flamethrower. I was told it was used for strategic forest burning or whatever to prevent forest fires. I figured if there was anything to kill a mass of animal flesh, it would probably be a flamethrower so I stole it.<br/><br/>With the flamethrower stolen (and properly tested), I made my way to where the crater was. Except it was gone. Somehow the entire crater had gone and reverted back to flat ground. There was no indication it had EVER been touched. The grass all matched the area outside where the crater once was, there was no disturbed dirt, there was not even any trail anymore.<br/><br/>I would have figured that I had finally lost it and had some delusion, but the stain that I got on my sleeve was still there, so I know that this all really DID happen.<br/><br/>All of this has made me come to the conclusion that this is probably some experimental government surveillance bio-weapon or something. I don’t know. </p>
      </div>
      <p>It’s been getting worse. I’ve noticed the strange tentacle things around my house. The stench of death that I found it with has started becoming more and more noticeable as the days go on. <br/><br/>I’ve even found one IN my house. One of its tendrils went into my vent system, and it had an eye actively watching me. <br/><br/>I’ve had enough of this all. I collected everything I needed from the house and burnt it down.<br/><br/>It’s clearly tracking me, so I can’t leave. I don’t know what would happen if this followed me to anywhere with any civilians. So I’ve decided I have to try and fight it. I’m going to go find it and destroy it. <br/><br/>I’m either going to win, or die trying.<br/><br/>I’ve set up a system using a cloud server. It will make a post after three days, as of me writing this. This is the post you are reading now. If I succeed in destroying the monster, I’ll write about what happened under this paragraph. And if there’s nothing under this paragraph… Well, you can read the post title. Remember me, and write me in your history books.</p>
